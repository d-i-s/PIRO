piro -- getting started


piro library consists acutally in two objects, [irmeasure~] and
[multiconvolve~]. [irmeasure~] is an object for creation of impulse
responses, [multiconvolve~] a real-time zero latency
convolver.

compiling piro:

piro includes binaries for osx32/64 bit, linux 64 bit, w32/64 and osx 64
bit double precision. otherwise it provides pd-lib-builder to compile it by yourself.
piro has been tested for vanilla (version number 0.50-2)
and purr-data single bit precision. if you have any questions do not
hesitate to contact me:

testing piro:

for [irmeasure~], open irmeasure~-help.pd, turn on dsp, click |sweep< method. you
should see the progress outlet go from 0 to 1 and when done you should
get a bang on the right outlet. at this point, click |getir< method,
that writes the impulse response by default on ir1 table. then, open
[pd soundfiler-write] and write ir1 table where you prefer. check your
impulse response with sw-ir.wav: you should obtain the same impulse
response. you can repeat the same procedure for mls method.

for [multiconvolve~], open multiconvolve~-help.pd, load impulse
responses using set method, turn on dsp, and play a soundfile.
